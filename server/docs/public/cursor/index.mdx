# Cursor Integration

> **Your AI stops forgetting. Give Cursor persistent memory.**

Every Cursor session starts fresh - your AI doesn't remember what it worked on yesterday. Claude-mem changes that. Your agent builds cumulative knowledge about your codebase, decisions, and patterns over time.

<Info>
**No Claude Code subscription required.** Use Gemini (free tier) or OpenRouter as your AI provider.

## How It Works

Claude-mem integrates with Cursor through native hooks:

1. **Session hooks** capture tool usage, file edits, and shell commands
2. **AI extraction** compresses observations into semantic summaries
3. **Context injection** loads relevant history into each new session
4. **Memory viewer** at http://localhost:37777 shows your knowledge base

## Installation Paths

Choose the installation method that fits your setup:

### Path A: Cursor-Only Users (No Claude Code)

If you're using Cursor without a Claude Code subscription:

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem.git
cd claude-mem && bun install && bun run build

# Run interactive setup wizard
bun run cursor:setup
```

The setup wizard will:
- Detect you don't have Claude Code
- Help you choose and configure a free AI provider (Gemini recommended)
- Install hooks automatically
- Start the worker service

**Detailed guides:**
- [Gemini Setup](/cursor/gemini-setup) - Recommended free option (1500 req/day)
- [OpenRouter Setup](/cursor/openrouter-setup) - 100+ models including free options

### Path B: Claude Code Users

If you have Claude Code installed:

```bash
# Install the plugin (if not already)
/plugin marketplace add thedotmack/claude-mem
/plugin install claude-mem

# Install Cursor hooks
claude-mem cursor install
```

The plugin uses Claude's SDK by default but you can switch to Gemini or OpenRouter anytime.

## Quick Commands Reference

After installation, these commands are available from the claude-mem directory:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `bun run cursor:setup` | Interactive setup wizard |
| `bun run cursor:install` | Install Cursor hooks |
| `bun run cursor:uninstall` | Remove Cursor hooks |
| `bun run cursor:status` | Check hook installation status |
| `bun run worker:start` | Start the worker service |
| `bun run worker:stop` | Stop the worker service |
| `bun run worker:status` | Check worker status |

## Verifying Installation

After setup, verify everything is working:

1. **Check worker status:**
   ```bash
   bun run worker:status
   ```

2. **Check hook installation:**
   ```bash
   bun run cursor:status
   ```

3. **Open the memory viewer:**
   Open http://localhost:37777 in your browser

4. **Restart Cursor** and start a coding session - you should see context being captured

## Provider Comparison

| Provider | Cost | Rate Limit | Best For |
|----------|------|------------|----------|
| Gemini | Free tier | 1500 req/day | Individual use, getting started |
| OpenRouter | Pay-per-use + free models | Varies by model | Model variety, high volume |
| Claude SDK | Included with Claude Code | Unlimited | Claude Code subscribers |

<Tip>
**Recommendation:** Start with Gemini's free tier. It handles typical individual usage well. Switch to OpenRouter or Claude SDK if you need higher limits.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Worker not starting

```bash
# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :37777

# Force restart
bun run worker:stop && bun run worker:start

# Check logs
bun run worker:logs
```

### Hooks not firing

1. Restart Cursor IDE after installation
2. Check hooks are installed: `bun run cursor:status`
3. Verify hooks.json exists in `.cursor/` directory

### No context appearing

1. Ensure worker is running: `bun run worker:status`
2. Check that you have observations: visit http://localhost:37777
3. Verify your API key is configured correctly
