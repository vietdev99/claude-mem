# Cursor + Gemini Setup

This guide walks you through setting up Claude-Mem in Cursor using Google's Gemini API. Gemini offers a generous free tier that handles typical individual usage.

<Info>
**Free Tier:** 1,500 requests per day with `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`. No credit card required.
</Info>

## Step 1: Get a Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Accept the Terms of Service
4. Click **Create API key**
5. Choose or create a Google Cloud project
6. Copy your API key - you'll need it in Step 3

<Tip>
**Higher rate limits:** Enable billing on your Google Cloud project to unlock 4,000 RPM (vs 10 RPM without billing). You won't be charged unless you exceed the free quota.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Clone and Build Claude-Mem

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem.git
cd claude-mem

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Build the project
bun run build
```

## Step 3: Configure Gemini Provider

### Option A: Interactive Setup (Recommended)

Run the setup wizard which guides you through everything:

```bash
bun run cursor:setup
```

The wizard will:
1. Detect you don't have Claude Code
2. Ask you to choose Gemini as your provider
3. Prompt for your API key
4. Install hooks automatically
5. Start the worker

### Option B: Manual Configuration

Create the settings file manually:

```bash
# Create settings directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude-mem

# Create settings file with Gemini configuration
cat > ~/.claude-mem/settings.json << 'EOF'
{
  "CLAUDE_MEM_PROVIDER": "gemini",
  "CLAUDE_MEM_GEMINI_API_KEY": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
}
EOF
```

Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

Then install hooks and start the worker:

```bash
bun run cursor:install
bun run worker:start
```

## Step 4: Restart Cursor

Close and reopen Cursor IDE for the hooks to take effect.

## Step 5: Verify Installation

```bash
# Check worker is running
bun run worker:status

# Check hooks are installed
bun run cursor:status
```

Open http://localhost:37777 to see the memory viewer.

## Available Gemini Models

| Model | Free Tier RPM | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` | 10 (4,000 with billing) | **Default.** Fastest, highest free tier RPM |
| `gemini-2.5-flash` | 5 (1,000 with billing) | Higher capability |
| `gemini-3-flash` | 5 (1,000 with billing) | Latest model |

To change the model, update your settings:

```json
{
  "CLAUDE_MEM_PROVIDER": "gemini",
  "CLAUDE_MEM_GEMINI_API_KEY": "your-key",
  "CLAUDE_MEM_GEMINI_MODEL": "gemini-2.5-flash"
}
```

## Rate Limiting

Claude-mem automatically handles rate limiting for free tier usage:

- Requests are spaced to stay within limits
- Processing may be slightly slower but stays within quota
- No errors or lost observations

**To remove rate limiting:** Enable billing on your Google Cloud project, then add to settings:

```json
{
  "CLAUDE_MEM_GEMINI_BILLING_ENABLED": true
}
```

You'll still use the free quota but with much higher rate limits.

## Troubleshooting

### "Gemini API key not configured"

Ensure your settings file exists and has the correct format:

```bash
cat ~/.claude-mem/settings.json
```

Should output something like:
```json
{
  "CLAUDE_MEM_PROVIDER": "gemini",
  "CLAUDE_MEM_GEMINI_API_KEY": "AIza..."
}
```

### Rate limit errors (HTTP 429)

You're exceeding the free tier limits. Options:
1. Wait a few minutes for the rate limit to reset
2. Enable billing on Google Cloud to unlock higher limits
3. Switch to OpenRouter for higher volume needs

### API key invalid

1. Verify your key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. Ensure there are no extra spaces or newlines in your settings.json
3. Try generating a new API key

### Worker not processing observations

Check the worker logs:

```bash
bun run worker:logs
```

Look for error messages related to Gemini API calls.

## Switching Providers Later

You can switch between Gemini, OpenRouter, and Claude SDK at any time by updating your settings. No restart required - changes take effect on the next observation.

```json
{
  "CLAUDE_MEM_PROVIDER": "openrouter"
}
```
